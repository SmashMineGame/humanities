  <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collective learning fosters advancements. There are numerous reasons that humans are much smarter than other species. We are always striving to get better while other species keep doing what their parents taught them to do. When we weren’t able to get better by genetic mutations, we developed a better and faster way of advancing. Collective learning helped human advancements have been much smarter and faster than all other species.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collective learning is the ability of a species to retain more information with one generation than is lost by the next, according to John Green from Crash Course. Most animals rely on genetic advancements to help them survive. On the other hand, humans rely collective learning. Collective learning is much faster and better than natural selection. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we always try to make our ideas better. One example of a species that didn’t use collective learning to advance is chimpanzees. They found out that they could use a small branch or a stick to draw termites out of their nest, but after a few hundred years, they still use the same method. They did not try to make the process easier or faster. They followed the saying, “if it ain't broke don’t fix it,” so they never advanced their technology. Humans, on the other hand, would have tried to advance their technology by asking others and improving on it every generation. Collective learning plays a big role in this.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second of all, collective learning involves more advancements and less problems. In natural selection, bad mutations are punished severely. Any destructive mutation, such as one fewer finger, would put that organism in a much worse position than the rest of the population. If all organisms used collective learning, then every species would be very advanced and extremely fit and ready for what they need to do to survive. ”While evolution by natural selection is a sort of learning mechanism that allows a species to adapt generation after generation with a lot of trial and error and death, collective allows for tinkering adaptation and improvement on a much faster scale with each generation and across generations without waiting for your genes to catch up,” says Mr. Green from Crash Course. collective learning is much better than natural selection because it allows humans to advance much faster and not have restrictions because of their genetic makeup.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, collective learning is the best way to advance technologically, scientifically and arithmetically. It does not punish failure and it helps organisms advance faster. Collective learning is based on what people think about and not random chance in their genes.
