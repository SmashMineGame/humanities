  <h1 class="display-3">Human Migration</h1>
  <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you ever wonder why humans are all over the world? Humans migrated because of food and climate. When humans got better at hunting, all the food in the area was used up. Also, Africa was becoming hotter and hotter which made is hard to live there. Due to these two things, humans had to migrate. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collective learning is the ability of a species to retain more information with one generation than is lost by the next, according to John Green from Crash Course. Most animals rely on genetic advancements to help them survive. On the other hand, humans rely collective learning. Collective learning is much faster and better than natural selection. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it was because of food.  When we became more complex and made better tools, it became a lot easier to hunt. We killed off all of the animals nearby and we didn’t want to wait for the plants to grow so then we left, out of Africa, to Asia. After Asia than even further. We can track their pattern by the extinction of animals around. They would go somewhere, kill off all the animals then leave. The entire process wasn’t only due to food, it could have also been climate.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is climate. The hot climate in Africa made it very hard to live there. they had to constantly hydrate and eat, causing us to use up a lot of precious food. They stuck to places near the equator, like India, but then when they ran out of that, they went out of their normal zone. Was migrating a good idea?
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Migrating was a great decision. If is was a choice or it was necessary we don't know for sure but this is what the evidence suggests. It created variety within the human race. We got different languages, skin color, and other adaptations based on where we live. It allowed us as humans to become a better species. Now we are where we are, the smartest creatures on the earth, because of the decision our ancestors made.</p></div>
